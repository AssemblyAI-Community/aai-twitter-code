# üéôÔ∏è PodClipper: Turn Podcasts into Viral Clips

A Streamlit web app that automatically finds the most engaging segments from long podcast episodes and turns them into shareable video clips using AssemblyAI. Here's a screenshot of the app after analyzing the Assembly Required series [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM3rgNM69Wg) with [Fireflies.ai](https://fireflies.ai/) CEO Krish Ramineni, where he talks with AssemblyAI CEO Dylan Fox about Fireflies' journey.

## üöÄ What it does

PodClipper helps you promote your podcasts on social media by:

- Analyzes your full podcast episode using AI
- Identifies the 3-5 most "clip-worthy" moments
- Creates ready-to-share video clips with captions
- Generates catchy titles for each clip
- All with zero editing skills required

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Rename `.env.example` and `.env` and add your [AssemblyAI API key](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup):
   ```
   ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Install FFmpeg (required for creating video clips):

   - **On Ubuntu/Debian:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
     ```
   
   - **On macOS (using Homebrew):**
     ```bash
     brew install ffmpeg
     ```
   
   - **On Windows:**
     Download and install from [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
     Add FFmpeg to your system PATH
     
   Note: The app can still analyze podcasts without FFmpeg, but won't be able to create video clips
